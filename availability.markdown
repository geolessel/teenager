# Availability

We're building an application that manages the availability of rooms. We need to be able to do 4 things:

1. See when a room is booked.
2. See when a room is available.
3. Book a room.
4. Cancel the booking on a room.

The application should not allow double bookings of a room.

How would you go about storing this information?
What is the public API?
