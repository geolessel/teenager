# Advanced Availability

We're building an application that manages the availability of 100 rental chairs. We need to be able to do 4 things:

1. See how many chairs are rented at any given time.
2. See how many chairs are available at any given time.
3. Rent any number of available chairs for any given time.
4. Cancel the rental of chairs.

The application should not allow double bookings of chairs.

The application should allow for multiple bookings to occur at the same time, if there enough chairs to split between the bookings.

How would you go about storing this information?
What is the public API?
